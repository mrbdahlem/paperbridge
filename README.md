<h1 align="center">PaperBridge</h1>

PaperBridge is the primary project in this repository. It focuses on printable PDF assignments, QR-stamped packet generation, and submission workflows for paper-first classrooms.

This repository also still ships the BentoPDF tool surface as a secondary capability. Public tool pages can remain BentoPDF-branded where they describe those PDF utilities.

## Repository Scope

- PaperBridge application code lives under `src/js/paperbridge/`.
- Shared tool pages and PDF utilities remain available in the broader app.
- Repository documentation now focuses on development and maintenance, not commercial terms, deployment recipes, or external agreement processes.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrbdahlem/paperbridge.git
cd paperbridge
npm install
npm run dev
```

By default, `npm run dev` serves on `http://localhost:5173` and `npm run preview` serves on `http://localhost:4173`.
Outside devcontainers both bind to `localhost`; devcontainers set `VITE_DEV_HOST=0.0.0.0` and `VITE_PREVIEW_HOST=0.0.0.0` so forwarded ports are reachable from the host machine.
Set `VITE_DEV_PORT` in your shell or `.env.development.local` if you need a different dev server port.
Set `VITE_PREVIEW_PORT` in your shell, `.env.local`, or `.env.production.local` if you need a different preview server port.
Dependency discovery and broad pre-bundling are disabled by default to keep local startup memory low; JSZip remains pre-bundled for the PaperBridge assignment flow.
Set `VITE_ENABLE_DEP_OPTIMIZER=true` to opt into broader Vite pre-bundling for heavier tool-page development.

Useful scripts:

- `npm run ci:paperbridge` runs lint, typecheck, tests, and build for the PaperBridge slice.
- `npm run ci:tools` runs lint, typecheck, tests, and build for the bundled PDF tools surface.
- `npm test -- --run` runs the full repository test suite.
- `npm run docs:dev` starts the docs site.
